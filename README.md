This tool will iterate over all of the plugin manifests found at https://github.com/logseq/marketplace and
clone the repositories they refer to, locally. If the repositories have already been cloned, they will be updated.

I was motivated to do this so that I could have a corpus of examples to search through when making my own plugins, as the
logseq plugin API documentation is not very helpful at the moment.
